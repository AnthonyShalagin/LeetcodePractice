/*
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.


10111 = 16 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

16/2 = 8
8/2 = 4
4/2 = 2
2/2 = 1

23/2 = 11
11/2 = 5
5/2 = 2
2/2 = 1

11 / 2 = 5
5/2 = 2
2/2 = 1
